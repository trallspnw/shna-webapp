Notable doc drift you should be aware of
  Your docs currently still describe a “demo mode via schema + subdomain” concept (duplicate schema, demo routing, manual sync of content-only). Since you’ve decided to cut that in favor of Test Mode, you’ll want to update:
  root README.md
  docs/DECISIONS.md (it contains the rationale/approach for demo mode)
  any runbook references to “demo Pages project”
