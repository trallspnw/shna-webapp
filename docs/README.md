# SHNA Documentation Index

Use this index to navigate the SHNA-specific documentation. The docs in this
folder are the canonical source of truth for architecture, workflows, and
operations.

## Canonical docs

- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — system design, environments, demo mode, localization, email strategy
- `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` — local development setup and workflows
- `docs/RUNBOOK.md` — operational procedures and incident playbooks
- `docs/DECISIONS.md` — decision log explaining why key choices were made
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` — phased roadmap and scope boundaries

## Reading order

2. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
3. `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`
4. `docs/RUNBOOK.md`
